    "instructions": "Sure! Here is a step-by-step cooking guide for Spaghetti Carbonara:\n\nStep 1: Cook the spaghetti in a large pot of salted boiling water according to the package instructions until al dente. Drain the spaghetti, reserving 1 cup of pasta water.\n\nStep 2: In a large skillet, cook the pancetta over medium heat until it becomes crispy and browned, about 5-7 minutes. Remove the pancetta from the skillet and set it aside.\n\nStep 3: In a mixing bowl, whisk together the eggs, grated Parmesan cheese, and black pepper until well combined.\n\nStep 4: Add the cooked spaghetti to the skillet with the pancetta fat. Toss the spaghetti in the fat for about a minute to coat it evenly.\n\nStep 5: Remove the skillet from the heat and quickly pour the egg and cheese mixture over the spaghetti. Toss the spaghetti continuously to coat it with the egg mixture. The heat from the spaghetti will cook the eggs, creating a creamy sauce.\n\nStep 6: If the sauce is too thick, gradually add some of the reserved pasta water to loosen it up until you reach your desired consistency.\n\nStep 7: Add the cooked pancetta back to the skillet and toss everything together until well combined.\n\nStep 8: Serve the Spaghetti Carbonara hot, garnished with additional grated Parmesan cheese and black pepper.\n\nEnjoy your delicious homemade Spaghetti Carbonara!"
